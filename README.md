# IOC Threat Report + Scanner 🕵️

This project mimics a real-world threat analysis workflow. It includes a threat report for the RedLine Stealer malware and a script to scan logs for known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

## 🔎 What's Inside
- `threat_report.md`: Summary of the threat, MITRE tactics, and known IOCs
- `ioc_scanner.py`: Python script to scan log files for matches
- `sample_data.txt`: Sample logs for testing

## 🧠 Why This Matters
This is the kind of work done by real SOC analysts and cybersecurity engineers: researching threats, extracting indicators, and scripting custom tools to help detect compromise early.
